My collection of znc modules.

These are built with 1.7.x, some of them will NOT work with 1.6.x

I have altered some of the default znc modules.

        - Support multiple hostmask like autoop.
    keepnick
        - Support MONITOR
            - Read the notes at the top of the module source code.
