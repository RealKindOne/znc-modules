My collection of znc modules.

These are built with 1.9.x.

I have altered some of the default znc modules.

    autovoice
        - Support multiple hostmask like autoop.
    keepnick
        - Support MONITOR
            - Read the notes at the top of the module source code.
    log
        - Uses older #channel_YYYYMMDD.log format.
		- No support for extended-join.
